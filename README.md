# Loops and Arrays

We use an array to store all the arrays we were going to evaluate.
 aoa = arrayOfArrays
with a for loop we go tru each array and than assign it to a temporal variable (let) that will store the values that will be evaluated.
arr = array is being evaluated
We initialize our assigment with a foor loop that wil go untill it reaches the array's length.
we managed to use ternary notation on one assignment.
For only-odds we the negation notation on the condition to find the odd numbers.
we use unshift to insert the values at the begining of the array to do the reverse.

have a good weekend.
